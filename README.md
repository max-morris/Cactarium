# The Cactarium

A registry for the Cactup ecosystem: **packages** of Cactus thorns (published from the authors'
own git repos, versioned by tags), **stacks** (versioned thornlists whose releases pin every repo),
and **sim files** (a parfile plus the exact configuration it ran on). The `cactup` CLI is its
client: `cactup add`, `cactup install owner/stack`, `cactup import owner/sim`.

The file formats, the CRL thornlist parser and the CCL scanner live in
[cactup-ecosystem-common](https://github.com/max-morris/cactup-ecosystem-common), shared with
cactup.

## Running it locally

Needs Docker (rootless is fine) and [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```bash
just dev        # build and start at http://localhost:8000, with development sign-in
just dev-seed   # demo repos, packages, stacks, a sim, a pending review, a moved tag
just smoke      # reset, seed, and exercise every page and action end to end
just logs       # follow the server's log
just dev-reset  # stop and delete the local database and demo repos
```

After seeding, sign in at http://localhost:8000/auth/login as `max` (superadmin, owner of the `et`
organization), `alice` or `bob`. The development sign-in and `file://` repos are refused unless the site is served from
localhost.

## Layout

- `crates/cactarium-server`: the server (axum, sqlx/Postgres, askama templates)
  - `src/tracker.rs`: following repos, freezing tags, noticing moved tags
  - `src/stacks.rs`: resolving stack definitions into releases
  - `src/sims.rs`: checking and publishing `.sim` files
  - `src/web/`: the site, the admin panel, the JSON API and the webhooks
  - `templates/`, `static/app.css`: the look; every color and size is a token in `app.css`
  - `migrations/`: the database schema
- `deploy/`: Dockerfile, Compose files, the demo seed and the smoke test

## Deploying

The production setup mirrors the CactUp tutorial server: the host's Apache terminates TLS and
proxies to the app, which Docker Compose publishes on loopback only. Copy `deploy/.env.example` to
`deploy/.env`, fill it in, then `just up`. `just update` snapshots the database, pulls, rebuilds,
migrates and restarts.

Server-side commands run in the app container with `just cli ...`:
`admin grant|revoke|trust|untrust|list`, `org create <name> <owner>`, `org add <name> <user>
[--owner]`, `org list`, `register`, `publish-sim`, `sync`, `token`. Create the `et` organization
with `just cli org create et <your-username> --display-name "Einstein Toolkit"`.
